class Person{
  constructor(name, age){
    this._name = name;
    this._age = age;
  }

  function increaseAge(){
    this._age += 1;
  }

  function changeName(newName){
    this._name = newName;
  }
}

The main reason that it's useful  to keep data and functions together in the same object is that this allows us to interact with the member variables of an object without touching them directly.
