# Functional programming

it is concerned with taking a large number of complex ideas present in any large computer program and organizing them in a coherent way, while at the same time making sure that *the code remains easy to test and modify*


bring the precision of mathematical functions into our programs.
## The difference between object-oriented and functional programming

it is in the choices they make with regards to organizing code. 

**The basic idea behind object-oriented programming is that humans think in terms of objects and relationships between these objects, and therefore computer programs should be organized in terms of objects so that we can leverage our existing thought patterns to write programs more easily.**

## Declarative vs imperative programming

- what does a house consist of? 4 walls + roof on the top

- How do I build a house? in order to make your house, you need to pour the foundation, build four walls and then put a roof on the top


*Declarative: What?*
> X is the sum of all the numbers in the array, divided by the length of the array.

*Imperative: how?*
> 1. Set x equal to zero
> 2. Add the first number in the array to x,
> 3 Repeat step 2 to the rest of the numbers in the array.
> 4 Divide x by the length of the array.

# Core concepts of functional programming
1. Immutability
2. Separating functions and data.
3. first class functions
