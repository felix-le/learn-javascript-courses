# Separation data and functions

## Data:
Data might be any values that a program contains.

In Objective-oriented programming, this data is usually wrapped up inside objects as member variables and the only way we can access it is using an object's methods.

In Functional programming

this  data is represented by simple arrays and hashes, objects.

## Functions

We can apply to our data to convert it into useful information.

# Class Object:

Functions are wrapped up inside objects along with the data that they operate on, and allow us to access or make changes to that data.

Data must be pass as arguments to functions instead of using the this keyword as in object-oriented programming.
